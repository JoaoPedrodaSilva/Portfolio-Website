                    </a> is my largest project.</p>
                <p>It's about financial education, the brazilian stocks market and some of the most important brazilian macroeconomics metrics.</p>
                <p>I've built it using the PERN stack - Node.js and Express.js as backend, PostgreSQL as database, and React.js as frontend - I also used TailwindCss for styling and D3.js for data visualization. </p>
                <p>The plan for the future is to implement a user authentication method, maybe using passport.js. Hopefully, I will implement some quality assurance too, with automated tests and Typescript, for example.</p>
